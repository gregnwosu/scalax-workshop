# ScalaX2Gether Workshop

The code for *Type-Oriented Programming: Building and using libraries for self-assembling programs* at
ScalaX Community Day 2018.

We're starting with this skeleton, and we're going to commit solutions to new branches as we go. I'll update
the master branch with a listing of which branches to look at after the fact.
